    2. One position can have several players.
    3. One player can have few player's data from different seasons. However, one player can only have one current season data.
    4. One user can have multiple roles.
* Project Approach:

    1. Create User, Role, Player, Team, Position, PlayerData.
    2. Used Hibernate to do the database schema migration.
    3. Used JDBC to connect project with Postgres.
    4. Configured Spring Security for Authentication.
    5. Created repository, service and did test.
    6. Created Controllers and Restful APIs.
    7. Did mock test for AWS S3 Storage service.
    8. Integrated third-party application AWS SQS and did Mock test.
 
    

## Build Project
1. Clone the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/Hange1995/NBA.git
```
2. Install Docker if necessary.
3. Use command window to spin up the PostgreSql database server using Postgres docker image.
```
docker pull postgres

docker run --name ${PostgresContainerName} -e POSTGRES_USER=${username} -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${password} -e POSTGRES_DB=${databaseName} -p ${hostport}:${containerport} -d postgres
```
4. Create Unit database on PGAdmin for unit testing
```
create database basketballDB_Demo_unit;
```
5. Environment properties configuration
```
location:./src/main/resources/META-INF/env
   
Template:
database.driverName=${driverName}
database.url=${url}
database.port=${port}
database.name=${name}
database.username=${username}
database.password=${password}
   
mvn compile -Dspring.profiles.active=${env}
```
6. Schema Flyway migration for creating tables in database
```
mvn compile flyway:migrate -P unit -Ddb_username=${username} -Ddb_url=localhost:${containerport}/${databasename} -Ddb_password=${password} 
```

## Test
- Package and install the folder before unit test 
```
mvn clean compile install -DskipTests=true
```
-Run the test with the command. All the Test are done using JUnit and Mockito
```
mvn compile test -Dspring.profiles.active=${unit} -Daws.region=${region} -Ddb_url=${localhost:5432/pigge_unit} -Ddb.username=${username} -Ddb.password=${password} 
```

## Packaging
```
mvn clean compile package -DskipTests=true
```
## API guideline and Reference DEMO
